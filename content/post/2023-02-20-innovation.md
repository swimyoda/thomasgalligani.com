Erik Johnson recently wrote an [article](https://warontherocks.com/2023/02/back-from-the-future-stop-saying-the-military-has-an-innovation-problem/) in War on the Rocks called "Back From the Future: Stop Saying the Military Has an Innovation Problem" in which he argues that "innovation theater" in DoD right now is missing the point and driving us away from rather than towards a better, faster modern acquisitions program. Specifically, he suggests that we need to delegate more to the private sector -- especially, silicon valley -- and let the experts innovate rather than pretending that the somewhat stunted and misshapen "DoD startups" are going to start producing actually gamechanging (or even generally useful on a practical level). He sees changing the acquisitions process to be more agile in its requirements and expectations as the answer, rather than trying to develop in-house "innovation" talent and capabilities. 

I have mixed feelings about his analysis. First of all, the initial problem he identifies is indubitably correct; "innovation" as a concept (in the way it is conceptualized by the various "DoD startups" and similar initiatives) is deeply missing the point. As they currently stand from my experience, the chase for "startup mentality" is . 

However, I don't think his conclusion is quite a coherent alternative. Ultimately, his proposal is not novel in anyway: DoD needs to not be dumb about its acquisitions cycle and adapt to the speed we need for great power competition in the 21st century. This is almost axiomatic at this point and anyone arguing that this is not the case (in some way) should not be in any position of authority. Johnson's argument, however, is that because innovation theater is a waste of time and money, we should only focus on developing acquisitions leaders that know how to bridge the gap between DoD bureaucracy and process and industry talent and requirements..


1) ("Innovation theater" is the only reason to develop internal capabilities)
2) "Innovation theater" is a waste of time and especially money
3) We should 

 should describe "what needs to be done" instead of "how to do it"
