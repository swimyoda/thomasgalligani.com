Welcome. Please, stay awhile. I can take your jacket.

My name is Tom Galligani, I'm an air force officer and operations research analyst. My professional interests are somewhere in the interesection of machine learning, information warfare, and what I might term the "philosophy of data science" -- but more instructively, I am interested in thinking about the pragmatistics of how we can, do, and should understand and respond to a bundle of threats that we currently tend to frame as "information."
